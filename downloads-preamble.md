This page contains 4 types of dictionary files:

1. Bilingual dictionaries - `kty-en-de.zip` for example has English headwords and their definitions/translations in German.
2. Monolingual dictionaries - `kty-en-en.zip` and such.
3. International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) dictionaries from a single wiktionary edition - e.g. `kty-en-en-ipa.zip`
4. Merged IPA dictionaries from all 6 wiktionary editions - e.g. `kty-en-ipa.zip`. These have more terms covered but not all the entries might be formatted the same way.

Note that [Kaikki](https://kaikki.org/dictionary/rawdata.html) currently only supports 6 wiktionary editions (English, Chinese, French, German, Russian and Spanish), so only dictionaries with definitions in these languages are available.

If the language you want isn't here, or you would like to see an improvement to a dictionary, please [open an issue](https://github.com/themoeway/kaikki-to-yomitan/issues/new).

Some of the dictionaries listed here are small; rather than decide on a lower bound for usefulness they are all included here. 

<sub><sup> Languages are referred to by their shortest [ISO code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639_language_codes) (ISO 639-1 where available, [ISO 639-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-3_codes) where not)</sup></sub>
